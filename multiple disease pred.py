Do not skip doses or stop taking medication without consulting your doctor. Regular Check-ups: Keep all scheduled appointments with your healthcare provider for ongoing assessment and management. \n2. Healthy Diet: Balanced Diet: Consume a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats (such as those from fish, nuts, and olive oil). Limit Sodium: Reduce sodium intake to help manage blood pressure. Avoid Trans Fats and Saturated Fats: Minimize the intake of foods high in unhealthy fats, such as fried foods and processed snacks. Monitor Portion Sizes: Be mindful of portion sizes to maintain a healthy weight. \n3. Exercise Regularly: Moderate Physical Activity: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, such as walking, swimming, or cycling. Strength Training: Incorporate strength training exercises at least two days a week. Consult Your Doctor: Before starting any new exercise regimen, discuss it with your healthcare provider to ensure it iss safe for you. \n4. Quit Smoking: Smoking Cessation: Seek support to quit smoking, as it significantly reduces the risk of heart disease complications. Avoid Secondhand Smoke: Stay away from environments where you might be exposed to secondhand smoke. \n5. Limit Alcohol: Moderate Consumption: If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. This typically means up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men. \n6. Manage Stress: Stress Reduction Techniques: Practice stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, deep breathing exercises, or hobbies you enjoy. Adequate Sleep: Ensure you get 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night.'

Whole Grains: Choose whole grains over refined grains. Lean Proteins: Include sources like fish, poultry, beans, and nuts. Healthy Fats: Use olive oil, avocados, and nuts, and limit saturated and trans fats. Limit Salt and Sugar: Reduce intake of added sugars and salt to maintain healthy blood pressure and glucose levels. \n2. Aerobic Exercise: Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of high-intensity aerobic activity per week (e.g., brisk walking, running, cycling). Strength Training: Include muscle-strengthening activities at least two days a week. Stay Active: Reduce sedentary behavior by incorporating more physical activity into daily routines, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator. \n3. Achieve and maintain a healthy weight through a combination of diet and exercise to reduce the risk of heart disease. Donâ€™t Smoke and Avoid Secondhand Smoke: \n4.
